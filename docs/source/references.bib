ABSTRACT = {Over the last decades quaternions have become a crucial and very successful tool for attitude representation in robotics and aerospace. However, there is a major problem that is continuously causing trouble in practice when it comes to exchanging formulas or implementations: there are two quaternion multiplications commonly in use, Hamilton’s multiplication and its flipped version, which is often associated with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This paper explains the underlying problem for the popular passive world-to-body usage of rotation quaternions, and promotes an alternative solution compatible with Hamilton’s multiplication. Furthermore, it argues for discontinuing the flipped multiplication. Additionally, it provides recipes for efficiently detecting relevant conventions and migrating formulas or algorithms between them.},

It defines the coordinate reference frame upon which all NSG coordinate systems (e.g. latitude/longitude/height; Military Grid Reference System) are based. It specifies the horizontal datum for all NSG mapping and charting, and provides parameters for transforming coordinates to other local horizontal datums. It provides precise coordinates of GPS tracking stations which form the basis of the WGS 84 coordinate reference frame. It defines the components of WGS 84, such as the ellipsoid (mathematical basis of coordinate systems); Earth Gravity Model (needed for elevation data, inertial navigation systems, etc.); and World Magnetic Model (needed for navigation and other applications).
